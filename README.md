## Restore Globally, Refine Locally: A Mask-Guided Scheme to Accelerate Super-Resolution Networks
### Sentences
- Instead of developing new SR networks, a recent trend is to reduce the parameter amount and/or FLOPs of existing ones while maintaining their SR capability.
- In this work, we aim to accelerate general SR networks while preserving their SR capability.
- However, handling different areas simply by multiple SR networks with adaptive depths still suffers from significant parameter growth.

## Efficient Long-Range Attention Network for Image Super-resolution
### Sentences
- Recently, transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in various vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the self-attention (SA) for feature extraction.
